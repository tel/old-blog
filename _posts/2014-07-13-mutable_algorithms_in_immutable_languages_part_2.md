Last time we saw a way to implement Union/Find, an algorithm which
depends critically on *observable* mutable memory, within a particular
abstract monad called `Mem`. Monads implementing `Mem` model mutable
memory (say *that* 10 times fast) and we saw that's sufficient
to recover Union/Find.

But we didn't actually see any implementations of `Mem`. So maybe
we're hosed. Are there any interesting implementations of `Mem` we can
run Union/Find in?

## In case of emergency break ivory

Okay, I'm being dramatic. There is, of course, at least one such
model. If we're willing to *infect* our program with `IO` then we can
always use `IORef`s to model mutable memory. It's almost too simple,
but we'll do it anyway for completeness and to explain some nits
involved in working with the `Mem` class.

Essentially, we'd like to have, more or less, the following
correspondences

* `ref` is `newIORef`
* `deref` is `readIORef`
* `set` is `writeIORef`

Hopefully, this also clears up why I called pointers "refs" back in
part 1.

### Diving in

*The code for this section is available [here][code-p1].*

[code-p1]:https://github.com/tel/tel.github.io/blob/master/public/code/MutableImmutable/Part2/UnionFind/IO.hs

So, we could do exactly what was just suggested and implement `IO`
into `Mem` (almost) directly. We'll need a `newtype` wrapper around
`Ref IO` but it's pretty trivial.

~~~
instance Mem IO where
  newtype Ref IO = IORef' { unwrapIORef' :: IORef Int }
  type    Val IO = Int

  ref     = fmap IORef . newIORef
  deref   = readIORef . unwrapIORef'
  set r v = writeIORef (unwrapIORef' r) v
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

Hopefully the major problem with this approach is obvious---`Mem`
restricts us to only store one *type* of thing in memory and `IORef`s
are more general than that. I had to pretty arbitrarily pick `Int`s to
store for this interface.

So this clarifies a point about using `Mem`. It's always going to be
an *internal*, hidden class where instances, probably created using
newtype wrappers, are specific to both a particular use and a
particular algorithm.

(Well, actually, we ought to be able to get around this by using GADTs
and existential types, but I'll leave that for another day.)

We'll thus make an entirely new wrapper called, say, `UfIO` for
Union/Find in `IO` and specialize the value to be wrapped in the
`Node_` layer as needed according to the internal `AbstractUnionFind`
interface.

~~~
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies               #-}

newtype UfIO v a =
  UfIO { runUfIO :: IO a }
  deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad )

instance Mem (UfIO v) where
  newtype Ref (UfIO v) =
    UfIORef { getUfIORef :: IORef (Node_ (UfIO v) v) } deriving ( Eq )
  type Val (UfIO v) = Node_ (UfIO v) v

  ref   a = UfIO (UfIORef <$> newIORef a)
  deref r = UfIO (readIORef $ getUfIORef r)
  set r v = UfIO (writeIORef (getUfIORef r) v)
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

Just a little bit more code and some noise as we wrap and unwrap all
of the `newtype`s (but note that all of that noise is free at
runtime).

### Using `UfIO`

Now that we have something which implements `Mem` with `Val r ~ Node_
r v` we can use it to run our Union/Find algorithm. All we need to do
is construct a computation using the Union/Find interface and then run
it with `runUfIO`.

~~~
exIO = runUfIO computation where
  computation :: UF r Int => r Bool
  computation = do
    n1 <- node 1
    n2 <- node 2
    link n1 n2
    connected n1 n2
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

~~~
>>> :t exIO
exIO :: IO Bool
>>> exIO
True
~~~

### Phantom parameters

It's worth spending a few seconds focusing one particular trick used
above. In order to leave the type *stored* in the Union/Find graph
unspecified we've used a *phantom type parameter* on the type of
`UfIO`, the `v`.

The parameter `v` is called "phantom" because it is not used in the
implementation of `UfIO` at all. Instead, the *information* carried by
`v` is only used in the *instantiation* of `Mem`.

This phantom parameter is almost entirely what allows us to avoid the
problem we encountered above with the `Mem` instance of `IO`. The only
way for the associated type `Val (UfIO v)` to change is if we use
information about some extra parameter like `v`.

Phantom parameters will return in this series. Generally, their
ability to *constrain* values and subsequently expose more information
about them is a critical trick.

## Recovering purity

*The code for this section is available [here][code-p2].*

[code-p2]:https://github.com/tel/tel.github.io/blob/master/public/code/MutableImmutable/Part2/UnionFind/IntMap.hs

Whew! With all that `IO` out of the way we can get back to solving
real fake problems like how to *emulate* mutable memory.

We've seen that what we need to do is establish the ability to store
objects of type `Val r` and produce references, `Ref r`, to them which
can be read from or written to. Without beating around the bush too
much, this behavior is very similar to that of storing and accessing
values from a finite `Map`. Better, if we just let our `Ref`s be
integer identifiers we can use the efficient [`Data.IntMap.IntMap`]
from [the `containers` package]

[`Data.IntMap.IntMap`]:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.5.1/docs/Data-IntMap.html
[the `containers` package]:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers

(There's a question as to whether or not we should use the *lazy* form
of IntMap, but I'm going to ignore it.)

If we wrap one of those maps up into [a `State` monad] then monadic
operations which edit the finite map by using integer references is
basically what `Mem` asks for. Better yet, we can just "snapshot" our
memory at any point (using [`get`]) to escape back into purity.

[a `State` monad]:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.1/docs/Control-Monad-State.html
[`get`]:http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.1/docs/Control-Monad-State-Strict.html#v:get

Sounds perfect. Let's build it!

### Implementing purely mutable memory

As described, we're going to implement a `Monad` which is not a whole
lot more than a `State` monad carrying around our `IntMap`
representing memory.

~~~
newtype UfIntMap v a =
  UfIntMap { unUfIntMap :: State (Uf v) a }
  deriving ( Functor, Applicative, Monad )
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

and as long as we can generate some initial state (`uf0`) then we can
"run" a `UfIntMap` computation purely, shedding its monadic layer.

~~~
runUfIntMap :: UfIntMap v a -> a
runUfIntMap = flip evalState uf0 . unUfIntMap where
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

That state type `Uf v` isn't exactly what I may have led you to
believe it would be. Instead of only holding an `IntMap` we must also
keep a "source" of IDs to ensure we don't collide.

~~~
data Uf v =
  Uf { count :: Int
     , mem   :: IntMap (Node_ (UfIntMap v) v)
     }

uf0 :: Uf v
uf0 = Uf { count = 0, mem = IM.empty }
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

But that's really just a small technical detail. All that's left now
is to implement the `Mem` instance. We use the same phantom variable
trick from `UfIO v`, but now references are just wrappers over `Int`s
in our map.

~~~
instance Mem (UfIntMap v) where
  newtype Ref (UfIntMap v) = UfIntMapRef { getId :: Int } deriving ( Eq )
  type    Val (UfIntMap v) = Node_ (UfIntMap v) v
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

### The methods of pure `Mem`

We're close now. We can implement `set` very easily atop monadic
operations in the `State` monad and `IntMap` operations using our
`Int` references.

~~~
  set r v = UfIntMap $ do
    modify (\s -> s { mem = IM.insert (getId r) v (mem s) })
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

Implementing `ref` is pretty easy as well, although we must be careful
to update the `count` stored in `Uf` to ensure that we never cause
collisions.

~~~
  ref v = UfIntMap $ do
    c <- gets count
    modify (\s -> s { count = c + 1, mem = IM.insert c v (mem s) })
    return (UfIntMapRef c)
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

Finally, we implement `deref` which is pretty simple as well.

~~~
  deref r = UfIntMap $ do
    Just v <- gets (IM.lookup (getId r) . mem)  -- WHOA!
    return v
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

Right?

Well, it's a little scary that we have an incomplete pattern match
(marked by `WHOA` above). But we never delete anything from the
`IntMap` so our references should always be valid. Our sanity test
passes after all.

~~~
exPure = runUfIntMap computation where
  computation :: UF r Int => r Bool
  computation = do
    n1 <- node 1
    n2 <- node 2
    link n1 n2
    connected n1 n2
~~~
{: .languge-haskell}

~~~
>>> :t exPure
exPure :: Bool
>>> exPure
True
~~~

*So this is fine, right?*

Well, *no*, otherwise I wouldn't be harping on it.

## A subtle bug

Here's how we can use our Union/Find API to expose an error. If you're
not familiar with Haskell *errors are bad* because you usually expect
all failure conditions to be reified in types and values.

~~~
bug :: Bool
bug =
  let
    n1   = runUfIntMap $ do
      node ()
      node ()
      node ()
    conn = runUfIntMap $ do
      n2 <- node ()
      connected n1 n2
  in
   conn
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

~~~
>>> bug
*** Exception: Pattern match failure in do expression at /.../UnionFind/IntMap.hs:43:5-10
~~~

We can do even worse, too. Here's the same error bug triggered such
that it just *silently, unpredictably provides the wrong answer*
without even throwing an error.

~~~
bug2 :: Bool
bug2 =
  let
    n1   = runUfIntMap (node ())
    conn = runUfIntMap $ do
      n2 <- node ()
      connected n1 n2    -- this can't possibly be True can it?
  in
   conn
~~~
{: .language-haskell}

~~~
>>> bug2
True
~~~

Ugh.

## Border control problems

What we've got is a border control problem. Because running our
`UfIntMap` computation can return values like `Ref (UfIntMap v)` we're
able to produce IDs on `Val`s outside of the context where they make
any sense.

In the first `bug` described we observe this problem when trying to
reference an id in a context where nothing has yet been storeed at
that location. In the second `bug2` we create a reference which,
despite being no longer valid, collides with a value in a different
context.

What this ought to tell you is that (a) there's a concept of a *region
of validity* that's defined by "run" calls like `runUfIntMap` and (b)
it's *dangerous* to export references from that region since they can
then contaminate other regions.

This isn't really a problem in languages where mutability is allowed
to happen everywhere. In some sense they only have a single
region---the entire runtime. The only way to "execute" this region is
to execute the problem itself.

## Can we do better?

So we've come quite far now. We have two separate implementations of
`Mem` and both appear to work correctly for Union/Find. One of them,
based on `IO`, is impure and so using the results of Union/Find
generated with that algorithm will pollute code with `IO`. The other,
based on a `State` monad containing an `IntMap` modeling mutable
memory, can be executed purely... but when we do we run into the
opportunity for subtle bugs to arise.

In some languages you might just have to shrug your shoulders and
write a note in the documentation.

> Never run a Union/Find computation which returns a `Node` as those
> nodes will no longer be meaningful and can be used to violate
> preconditions in other Union/Find computations.

But we're fighting this whole problem in order to preserve the
strength of the type sytem. Can we make the type system pay its dues?

Turns out that, yes, we can. And will.
