There is no royal road to math.

There are instead, roughly, between 4 and 50 branches of mathematics
which each start and "end" in different places with different goals
and philosophies and styles.

What makes this all "math" is that almost inexplicably these branches
tread the same ground over and over. Which is to say: learning one
branch can dramatically improve your ability to understand another
branch. Learning several builds your "mathematical intuition" all
together.

In order to learn more math you will most likely want to choose one of
these branches and study it intensely. You will not want to start from
first principles to begin. Nobody does, it's too complex. Instead, you
should seek to understand some set of "introductory core ideas" from
that branch.

In order to study any branch you will need to learn the language of
mathematics: logic, theorems and proofs. Essentially, this is a
language you can think in and speak. Without it, you will be incapable
of carefully expressing the kind of sophisticated ideas math is
founded upon.

Fortunately, programming is an application in logic. If you can
program a computer you're between 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the way to
understanding mathematical logic well-enough to begin to understand
mathematical argument. That said, you will not yet know enough. There
are books which teach this language directly (Velleman's How to Prove
It, perhaps) and there is an entire field of study of this
language. Usually, however, you just learn by doing. Certain branches
are more amenable to this learning of the logical language than
others.

One thing to note about the logical language that would be told to you
by any teacher but is only mentioned in a few books is that it is not
much like English in that you can just listen to or read something in
the logical language and have it immediately form a cogent picture in
your mind. Mathematical language is a language of action---you MUST
complete proofs, often on your own, in order to have grasped what was
being said. This doesn't mean there isn't value in skimming a math
book and reading the results without doing the proofs. Indeed, that's
often a great first pass through a book! But think of doing that like
reading the Cliff's Notes for a great work of literature. You might be
able to talk about it a little bit, but you certainly haven't
understood the material.

One final note with respect to learning any branch—where you start is
critical. Often, even the simplest reviews of the material of one
branch of mathematics will assume "basic, working knowledge" of many
other branches. This is done in order to accelerate learning for those
who possess that working knowledge—it takes advantage of the frequent
crossover properties from one branch of mathematics to
another. Finding resources which do this minimally will be important
to begin... but you will probably not succeed entirely. Sometimes, you
just have to read a math book and walk away from it without being too
much the wiser, but recognizing that there was some technique from
another field you could learn to unlock a deeper understanding.

Some major fields of mathematics are:

1. Algebra. This is like and unlike what you may call algebra
   today. It is the study of how things are built and
   decomposed. Indeed, it notes that many "things" can be described
   entirely in terms of how they are built and decomposed. It is often
   a good place to begin for programmers as it espouses a way of
   thinking about the world not dissimilar to the way we model domains
   in while programming. Some books include Algebra: Chapter 0 by
   Aluffi and Algebra by MacLane.

2. Combinatorics. This is the study of "counting", but counting far
   more complex than anything meant by that word in normal usage. It
   is often a first field of study for teaching people how to read and
   speak proofs and theorems and therefore is well recommended. It is
   also where the subfield of graph theory (mostly) lies which makes
   it more readily accessible to programmers with an algorithms
   background. I can recommend West's Introduction to Graph Theory,
   but only with the caveat that it is incredibly dry and boring---you
   will get out of it what you put into practicing the proofs and
   nothing more.

3. Topology. This is the study of what it means for one thing to be
   "near" another. Similarly, it is the study of what it means to be
   "smooth". It's a somewhat more abstract topic than the others, but
   in modern mathematics it holds a privileged role as its theorems
   tend to have surprising and powerful consequences elsewhere in
   mathematics. I don't know any good introductory material
   here---perhaps Munkres' Topology.

4. Calculus and Analysis. This is the study of "smooth things". It is
   often the culminating point of American high school mathematics
   curricula because it has strong relationship with basic
   physics. Due to this interplay, it's a remarkably well-studied
   field with applications throughout applied mathematics, physics,
   and engineering. It is also the first "analyst's" field I've
   mentioned so far. Essentially, there are two broad styles of
   reasoning in mathematics, the "algebraicist's" and the
   "analyst's". Some people find that they love one much more than the
   other. The best intro book I know is Spivak's Calculus.

5. Set Theory. This is, on its surface, the study of "sets" which are,
   often, the most basic mathematical structure from which all others
   arise. You should study it eventually at this level to improve your
   mathematical fluency---it's a bit like learning colloquial English
   as compared to just formal English. More deeply, it is a historical
   account of the philosophical effort to figure out what the absolute
   basis of mathematics is---a study of foundations. To understand Set
   theory at this level is far more challenging, but instrumental for
   understanding some pieces of Logic. This can therefore be a very
   useful branch of study for the computer scientist investigating
   mathematics. I don't know a good introductory book, unfortunately.

6. Number Theory. This is, unlike the others above excepting "surface"
   Set theory, a branch which arises from studying the properties of a
   single, extremely interesting mathematical object: the
   integers. Probably the most obvious feature of this field is the
   idea that numbers can be decomposed into "atomic" pieces called
   prime numbers. That idea is studied generally in algebra, but the
   properties of prime numbers escape many of the general
   techniques. I don't know a good introductory book, unfortunately.

7. Measure Theory and Probability Theory. Measure theory is the study
   of the "substance" of things. It generalizes notions like length,
   weight, and volume letting you build and compare them in any
   circumstance. Furthermore, if you bound your measure, e.g. declare
   that "all things in the universe, together, weigh exactly 1 unit",
   then you get probability theory---the basis of statistics and a
   form of logical reasoning in its own right. I don't know a good
   introductory book, unfortunately.

8. Linear Algebra. A much more "applied" field than some of the
   others, but one that's surprisingly deep. It studies the idea of
   "simple" relationships between "spaces". These are tackled in
   general in (general) algebra, but linear algebra has vast
   application in the real world. It's also the most direct place to
   study matrices which are vastly important algebraic tools. I don't
   know a good introductory book, unfortunately.

9. Logic. A much more philosophical field at one end and an intensely
   algebraic field at the other. Logic establishes notions of
   "reasoning" and "judgement" and attempts to state which are "valid"
   for use as a mathematical language. Type Theory is closely related
   and is vital for the development of modern programming languages,
   so that might be an interesting connection. I don't know a good
   introductory book, unfortunately.

Hopefully, some of the ideas above are interesting on their
surface. Truly understanding whether one is interesting or not is
necessarily an exercise in getting your feet a little wet, though: you
will have to dive in just a bit. You should also try to understand
your goals of learning mathematics---do you seek beauty, power, or
application? Different branches will be appealing based on your goals.

Anticipate studying mathematics forever. All of humankind together
appears to be on the path of studying it forever---you personally will
never see its end. What this means is that you must either decide to
make it a hobby, a profession, or to consciously leave some (many)
doors unopened. Mathematics is a universal roach motel for the
curious.

But all that said, mathematics is the most beautiful human
discovery. It probably always will be. It permeates our world such
that the skills learned studying mathematics will eke out and provide
value in any logical concern you undertake.

Good luck.
