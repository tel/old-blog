[I gave a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRUPr322COQ&feature=youtu.be)
for
[Papers We Love, Boston](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston/events/203312152/)
on the 18th where I discussed Martin-Löf type theory from a historical
and programming context. The goal was to motivate and inspire reading
the (notably long) 1983 Martin-Löf lectures
[*On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws*](https://github.com/michaelt/martin-lof/blob/master/pdfs/Meanings-of-the-Logical-Constants-1983.pdf?raw=true). [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRUPr322COQ&feature=youtu.be) was just posted and the slides [are available here](http://jspha.com/public/slides/PapersWeLoveBOS_Sept19th_MartinLof_Intuitionism_Programming.pdf).

The hosts, [Ashley Williams](https://twitter.com/ag_dubs) and
[Bob Holt](https://twitter.com/bobholt) from
[Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/) were absolutely wonderful and I really
appreciate Bob's work editing and producing
[the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRUPr322COQ&feature=youtu.be).

All in all, it was a great experience and I'm really appreciative of
everyone who helped put the talk together, who are building Papers We
Love, and, most of all, everyone who attended, asked questions, and
continued after the talk with great conversation.

Thanks so much!
