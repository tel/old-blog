title: Comma Categories
---

Comma Categories are a secret weapon. They're a way of examining a
category as it's viewed through two functors $$ D
\overset{F}{\rightarrow} C \overset{G}{\leftarrow} E$$. Written $$(F
\downarrow G)$$, the Comma category of $$F$$ and $$G$$ is the
collection of $$C$$-arrows from domains in $$D$$ to codomains in
$$E$$. In other words, objects $$(d \in D, f \in C(Fd, Ge), e \in
E)$$, or in a picture:

$$
\begin{align}
    \star \overset{d}{\rightarrow} D \overset{F}{\rightarrow} &C \\
        & \left\downarrow \tiny{f} \right. \\
        & C \overset{G}{\leftarrow} E \overset{e}{\leftarrow} \star
\end{align}
$$

Arrows are pairs of arrows in $$D$$ and $$E$$ which build commuting
squares
