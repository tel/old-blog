title: Inspiration of Djikstra
---

Over the last year the technical work of many people has been greatly
inspiring to me. If I were to separate inspiration the technical and
the non-technical, though, they would be of nearly equal weight. And
if I were to seek the source of the non-technical inspiration of late
it would be nearly entirely Djikstra.
